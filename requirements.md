# BOOK APP

## WHAT DOES THE "BOOK APP" NEED TO DO?
It needs to be a portal for Learning resource reviews

## DESCRIBE "BOOK APP"
It has text, images and links to books. Its content should be searchable and MAYBE have a rating system. It should create learning paths based on the content. It should adhere to SEO best practices...be fast-loading, use schema.org data, and the content strategy should be in place before serious coding starts.  It should work on mobile and take accessibility seriously.

## WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT CLASSES
*ITEM (ABSTRACT SUPER CLASS)
* Book (a sub-class)
* Site (a sub-class)
* Video (a sub-class)
* Learning Matrix (a sub-class? polymorphic? just one big view?)

## HOW DO THEY INTERACT FOR NOW
They don't right now but may share properties and methods some way in the future.
