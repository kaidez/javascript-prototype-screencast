Remove console.log and "test" constructor function before you start recording.

So I'm going to start building the two methods I discussed...one to configure the home options and another to display them on a page. Before I do, take note that note that I removed both the console.log statement that was inside the Blueprint function, and I also got rid of that var test instance that was below the function as well.

Also, real quick, I'm going to write shorthand code for the common home properties I wrote in the last movie....like this...string all the propeties with equal signs and end things using "true" here.

And this is valid JavaScript...it means the same thing as I had here before
