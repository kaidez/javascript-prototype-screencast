Hello and thanks for checking out my introduction to prototypes screencast, with prototypes being how you simulate class inheritance in JavaScript. I'm doing this screencast for 2 reasons...

First, I've had a a few people ask me what prototypes are and how they work, and some of them are relatively new to JavaScript. And I have a feeling that there are many other JS newbies that are that have the same question. So I wanted to put together this screencast to help those people out.

And the second reason was to share what I learned. All the code and coding patterns you're gonna SEE in this screencast is the result of my just buckling down for a few days and really JUST hacking together some JavaScript prototype code.

I've used prototypes before in production code annnd I understand them. But I wanted to take some time and just focus on them 100 percent so I could really really REALLY understand them.

Also, with web components (which are really really REALLY new at the time I'm recording this), prototypes play a big role. If you use web components to create a custom element, you can use prototypes to inherit properties of already existing elements like button and span tags.

MOST of the documentation around this that I've seen is written in a way that assumes that you understand how prototypal inheritance works...not all, but most.
