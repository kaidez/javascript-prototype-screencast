# An Introduction to JavaScript Prototypes

This is the repo for the accompanying source files for an upcoming screencast tutorial of mine on JavaScript prototypes.

The screencast demomstrates how I build out files using a Node/Browerify setup, but you can see how the code works without it.

## Look at the code without Node/Browserify

1. open up the `index.html` in the `build` folder.
2. go to the bottom of that file and comment out `<script src="js/main.js"></script>`.
3. Uncomment `<script src="js/main-full.js"></script>`...this file contains the complete code in the screencast.
